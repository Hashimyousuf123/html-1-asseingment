        We will spend the first chapter
        looking at how HTML is used to
        create web pages. You will see
        that you start by writing down
        the words you want to appear
        on your page. You then add tags
        or elements to the words so
        that the browser knows what is
        a heading, where a paragraph
        begins and ends, and so on.
